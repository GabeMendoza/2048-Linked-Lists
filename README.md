##2048 - CONSOLE - C++

This is the text based console port of the 2048 game made by [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) that I wrote as a project for a programming course at UIC. This game, written in C++ uses Linked Lists to store every move made in order to be able to "undo" and revert back to the previous board, all the way back to the beginning of the game.

Feel free to contribute with pull requests to make the game more efficient.
##Building

If you want to build from source just do the folloeing from the proper directory, replacing SYSTEM with UNIX for Linux/Mac or WIN for 32/64bit Windows.

	1)  g++ 2048_LinkedLists_SYSTEM.cpp -o 2048	
	2)  ./2048 for Unix bases systems
				or
		2048.exe for windows bases systems.

##Donations

I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying me coffee, you can donate at my BTC address:

Thank you very much!
