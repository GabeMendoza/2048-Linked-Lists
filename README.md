2048 - Console - C++

This is the text based console port of the 2048 game made by [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)
that I wrote as a project for a programming course at UIC. This game, written in C++ uses Linked Lists to store every move 
made in order to be able to "undo" and revert back to the previous board, all the way back to the beginning of the game.

Feel free to contribute with pull requests to make the game more efficient.
